# daisync, a modifiable-time-machine backup tool
daisync is a time-machine backup tool. MNI, U of michigan has been using it for decades to backup petabytes of files every night with time machine. End users can go to one of many daily backups to retrieve files on their own.

Now with the new feature '-c reflink' enabled in March 2022, the time-machine backups are modifiable. It means any of the time-machine backups can be modified, while the modification on one backup won't affect any other time-machine backups.

## Installation
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daimh/daisync/master/daisync
chmod +x daisync
mv daisync ~/bin/ # or any directory in your PATH
```

## Try it

1. prepare a directory for tests
```
mkdir src
seq 2 | split -l 1 - src/old
tree src
```

2. backs up all files under directory 'src' to 'dst'
```
mkdir -p dst/0000
daisync -s src/ dst
tree dst
```

3. change some files in src, and back them up again
```
seq 2 | split -l 1 - src/new
daisync -s src/ dst
tree dst
```

4. exclude a subdirectory from backup
```
mkdir src/this-is-excluded-from-daisync
touch src/this-is-excluded-from-daisync/demo
daisync -s src/ dst
echo "*-excluded-from-daisync" > dst/.daisync-exclude-from
daisync -s src/ dst
tree dst
```

5. use rsync parameter to exclude file that is less/greater than 10 bytes
```
seq 10 > src/big
daisync -s src/ dst
daisync -s "--max-size=10 src/" dst
tree dst
```

6. relink moved big file to save space

```
seq 200000 > src/1M
daisync -s src/ dst
stat dst/0000/1M
mv src/1M src/1M-MOVED
daisync -l 1 -s src/ dst
stat dst/0001/1M dst/0000/1M-MOVED | grep Inode #It shows the same Inode
```

7. create locate database to find file quickly
```
daisync -ds src/ dst
locate -d dst/0000/.daisync-locate.db new | sed -e "s/.*\.daisync\///" #sed is added to only show the relative path under 'dst/0000'
```

## Help
```
daisync -h
```
